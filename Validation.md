# Requirements Validation

Validating requirements is an important part of the requirements engineering process. Requirements are typically validated through user acceptance testing. By having a user validate the project prototype, the prototype is able to be analyzed by the user and is subject to their standards of "good." This step is important because regardless of whether the product being developed fits the development team's vision of a successful and complete product, the user holds the key to validating the project.

# Behavioral Requirements

The requirements engineering process supports the validation of behavioral requirements by providing a means for the users of a system to interact with the system because it's fully completed. Behavioral requirements specify how users interact with the system in terms of output and input. Given a prototype or wireframe, the user can directly experience a potential implementaiton of a system. From there, the user/tester can directly perform system analysis. From a developer perspctive, the user experience can also be analyzed to improve the system in areas where the user/tester hadn't realized could use improvement.

# Requirements Summary

## Project Inception

The requirements engineering process for this project started by proposing the idea of an information website to the Product Owner/Lead Developer. Once the project idea was decided, we immediately started brainstorming requirements. From the first session, a majority of the functional requirements were elicited along with some constraints. After this session, we conducted an interview to elicit more functional requirements as well as non-functional requirements. 

## Interview

For our interview of the Product Owner, we asked the open-ended questions listed below:

* What information would you like to display about the developer?
* What information would you like to display about the business?
* What information would you like to display about the games?
* Is there anything else you would like the website to display?

During the interview, the Product Owner revealed to us that, as part of the business rules, certain procedures regarding user data must be followed. This is because practices regarding user data are sometimes seen as overly intrusive. Because of this, the Product Owner would like to keep user data storage to a minimum. This need (business rule) takes consideration of public safety as well as cultural standards.

## Wireframing

As the latest step in our process of requirements engineering, we developed wireframes for the Product Owner to review. After reviewing the wireframe, the Product Owner provided us with feedback to improve the next version. After applying the feedback to our design, we started designing the prototype for User Acceptance Testing.
